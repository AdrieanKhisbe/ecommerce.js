## How to contribute to ecommerce.js

* Before you send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/thebergamo/ecommerce.js/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to have tested the feature.

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the application.

* In your pull request, do not add documentation. We'll do those things before cutting a new release.
